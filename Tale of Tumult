Ch 1

Tumult.

He likes turbulence. A turbine in his own right, teeming with tempest. Salt-pepper hair had aged much, in a whisp.

Witch.

She blew in like lighting. No time for this shit. This bitch knew her game like the top of her tits.

Chagrin. 

He played chess like he lived. An ass some would say, he'd asked for this. His father had taught him the ways of the game. His name would eventually fade to mist except in the eyes of his son, who was miffed.

Miss.

She smoked a joint. Raised as a boy, the girl had would not sleep without ending him. Utter destruction to man. A master, she played with her toy.

Chaos.

He played his best! A wild rip roaring of wins, but a mess. No rhyme, reason or stress (so he hoped). Nimbly, he made them a bed. Simply, they'd fall under deep rest. Never noticed 'till, wham, and then next. But now...

Impressed.

The girl was a crafty one. A spider. A demon black mass. Clearly the leers had amassed on the guy. The man seemed a puddle beneath her feet. And yet, Tumult pressed. Played out his heart. Layed it all on the table 'till...

Damn.

She'd made him. Girl sat across from the couple, abreast. Glimmer she saw on his left. Somebody new had appeared on the scene. Before nobody knew how to unseat the king. He asked them her name.

Solice. 

Many a life had she lived. Many a mile traversed, bridged. Been reading books with Maleficent's grin since a kid, never abridged. Many a year to prepare for this.

Back to the scene.

Then, well, his madness was calm. His dad was still with him, a best friend he'd lost, but now he saw someone in whom he could fall. 

Again.

She knew his name. She'd heard, it'd been said, he's best these days, yet she'd bested him. Solice knew deeply she couldn't back down. He'd append. Something he'd say about something she did. Couldn't have that now could we?

Ch 2

West.

Solice's husband. Solipsistic at best. I heard you two were out all night again. The vine, she speaks, you know? In the end, juices will run down our cheeks to our chins. If only you'll give me the time, my old friend.

Unnerving.

She'd heard it before. Tired of his sin. Lied like the tip of his dick in her mouth; limp. She hated him. No peace, just money for pain he caused them. He took her children to pasture for bed. Told her that night. She ceased to live.
