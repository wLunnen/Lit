Thinking in terms of one half of the earth that loves the other side it cannot see

Sun earth as can be seen by one another 

The moon is a cool example too, but not the dark side light side thing too much (side seen and unseen) 

Moon earth orbit what orbits (gravitation)

Moon and stars (akin)

Question and answer (like gratification, one beckons)

Gratification process (one that follows the other chronologically)

Colliding bodies (fusion, cohesion)

Reaction (play on colliding, beckoning with affect)

Coagulation (melding/mold)


Most of the day spent enamored or lost. Postumous love that means nothing. Laws that encompass us wrought with ambitions of those still detested. I'm after us. I'm at a loss what to do without half of my mind ever present. Pent up with daunting, quite, thoughts. Not much is left for a man marinated in hatred or loathing or looming death. Posh seems the world to a lover left often. Dredging through waters too deep to be walking. Up to my neck now with murky weep. Washing. Whims, whit and whimsy. All that seems gone now. I'm lost again. 

My art. My words. My works. My process. My heaven. My goals. My verse. My haunting endeavors. My patient endurance. My bane of existence. My awe. My pain. My hurts.

Mines and my feet. In embankments. Heaped and curtailed. Vehement means for by which I made merry again. Veiled efforts, peat, grow like moss on a dead headed trail. Feign at my weakness. Rain everywhere. Weight like ocean. I prevail. 

Pale in comparison. Hail. I'm like ice from the sky. Sailed in the wind for so long I'm a diamond. Impale. Cut. Contusion. Concluding I'm finished. I've failed, but not really. Wailing at me, I stand tall with no ceiling. Braying at me, I've been brined. Whaling. Wind. I'm Moby and Ahab. End. Time.
