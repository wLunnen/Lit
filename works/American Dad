As life moves forward, we get a pretty clear picture of how things are going to look going forwards. Occasionally, we get to a moment in our collective existence where one or more discoveries are made that create a beautiful array of what is not only possible, but achievable in our lifetimes. With the rapid progression of the sciences (computer science, earth science, social science), we've started to see the possibility that something like life can emulate the most magnificent realities fathomable. Devices integrated with our person definitely seems like something out of an American Dad episode, but be on the lookout for how innovations such as this come to fruition in products you'll see from some of top companies currently featuring wearables, home and health products to software development, medical and much more.

This is an exciting time to get to enjoy the benefits of our collective knowledge base. Knowing the possibility this could reach the every-day market is incredible and speaks to the needs of the collective just as much as the individuals who enlighten us with such discoveries. One day, today, we endeavor toward seeing a future where we are integrated more closely with our world.

What a beautiful thing.
