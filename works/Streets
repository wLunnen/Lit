They say the streets don't lie, but they fib so I need to make sense when I'm with em n say shit that so listenable, there just ain't no way I couldn't've made it.
I'm a musician first and foremost. I'd like to say this is a PR move, but it isn't. This is a big situation that I'll show you clearly and under no uncertain terms or circumstances I'm innocent. They say if the glove don't fit it means acquittal. I've memorized the conversations I plan to have down to the minute. I mean that in the present, future, and past tense. If ever there's a lie about me, I more than remember the moment, to the sentence. If you believe in God, this is it. If you fear what's becoming, assuage me your thoughts a reprisal from what we're about to experience. I can't say I'm perfect, but I did have a plan that I followed. My only defense is the where's when's and why's of my own life that coincide with'an'n yours. Where you're at in your investigation was just an inference on my part. I figured as much, maybe more just considering I've done no more than be honest in my own intentions to change my own life for the better by simply being boring and normal. An entrepreneur and held down my day job for so long, it's obvious to an honest man something had happened that made it all go wrong. I'm just the man in the clearing. Seen a few things that I shouldn't have. My life's now in shambles from drugs I don't do. I'm an honest enabler of alcohol, marijuana and choosing within the confines of the law, which the people enact through a process that's due. I was denied that on several occasions, and thus my rights now've been taken. I was targeted here with a car, and several other times too. Driven by scenes set to scare me from something I never did. Stupid. Please forgive my frustrations. I know you would be too.
'Now the streets all lie, and they fib so I'ma make sense when I'm with em n say shit that so listenable, there just ain't no way I couldn't've made it to the bigs.
