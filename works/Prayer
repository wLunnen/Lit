Thank you Father for the sky
Thank you for the food and the water, my life
Love you my kin, king and the father, holiest spirit 
Clearly in time you'll start getting it, giving em hell for the night
Tell me I'm time
Take me up in
End me, my love
End you, my dear
Let's make a life
Let's make em livid
That hate us, but why?
Honey my sugar, she ain't no lipid
Literally living, I'm lime
She the corona, but this ain't no season
We need a reason to be together?
Oh Lord, just give me a wife
Make me your plug
You be my outfit
Promise I'll only wear you at night 
But then by the morning I've already gone and changed up my mind

Taking up all of time 
Me and my love, honey I'm up now 
Can we please have us a life
