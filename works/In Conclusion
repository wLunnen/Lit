back then, before the great divide, when there was still some semblance of a world alltogether there was a decision made and a decision not respected. this was the great divide. the gap none could bridge but by god himself with his reach immeasurable, as it were. i am loved by a creator who knows when enough is enough. a creator like that has my heart. a creator who can make anything and chose to make me. who chose to save me. not because he had to. he even may have wanted not to at one time... and yet he has. he is. and he forever shall. 
back to our story, the men thought themselves like him. they played with the minds, these beasts in our skin with black hearts like ours but just barely. such fools in our midst, but so are we in a way. different, but equally lowly. still, these men from the mist, bring their tumult. making twists in the lines of our finite lives. 
god, they/them think thee. but these bees buzzing about me, all around me, they are dead to me now as i flee ever onward to bed.
