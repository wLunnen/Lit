Exposition:
Characters: the DA (she/her), the defense (D), Earnheart (E/Earn), the Narrator (N), the Journal (J), the Judge (Ju), the Jury (TJ - comprised of 13 individuals), and of course the Horse 
Pretext: 
Courtroom (obvious for some, not others - be civil), Murder Trial, Small town in the desert (Old West style - we'll call it Mourning like in Midas' Tale which I just decided is in Georgia - it's up to you to imagine if I mean the state or the country)
Overarching stuff: 
This book is a part of a larger series that will be *huge* so start thinking about all the awesome ways the novel could go if you just BELIEVE it will connects with the main plot somehow (and it will, I promise), all named characters are important to us and all unnamed characters are important to the named characters and are still (by my definition) named their respective title and I love all my characters so many supporting roles will get stories of their own someday after the main plotline has emerged
Fun fact: 
The narrator is gay, which I find *very* funny.
Please: 
Enjoy.

Ch 1 - Earn - "All That I Got"

N: 
Ever was a man like that as this, but few and far between and best. His crisp collar a'like the flick of his wrist; lay bare in the sun, under hat with ridges lifted. Horseback, as always. Long leathers over britches. Never missed a shot. Guessed the weather, too. 

J:
I predict desert heat... for some weeks. - D Earnheart, Western Region, c. late 1821

Ch 2 - Proving G   o     d
                              r   un   s

N:
Forever ago, it'd seemed, to the man on stand; he believed. To the rest, it had been a few weeks.

E:
This must be a-many years old. I should see if I can't sell it of'fer a penny or 3.

N:
Horse, his steed, settled in; locking knee. He'd needed, again, just a minute to be. His rider stopped often to look at such things. For many were the sights, but all unforseen. Even the horse would admit... 

E:
...it was magnificent! A bein'! So, I thought I'd see...

N:
...said Earn to the people in preposterous heat. Smelled like dead in the summer, too. Awful. It reeked. 

E:
A sword in a hand from the sand underneath. The body was buried. The head could be seen. Flesh off the bone; clean. Nothing for teeth. Armor engulfed it; the skeleton preened. Crown on its head...

N:
...or at least he'd perceived. 

E:
The air filled with melody; sweet like a dream. Some time passed by, like that...

N:
...that he'd seen. Memories. A dam bursting back at the seams.

E:
Then black. 

Ch 3 - *Snap

E:
I think I passed out.

N:
Earn landed face in the dirt, per vernacular. Nothing for miles but dunes, many that. I assure you. He rolled himself over, till Horse was at back. Heavy laden, our hero still burdened with pain, basked in the shade and said,

E:
Horses are good for a-many great things. I must end my journey rather fast...

N:
...to the east.

E:
This dang desert's plainer than plain, as I see!

N:
Wary, the traveller, parried the scene. 
Silent, his creature, corralled like a leaf; gracefully. Shifting of sand, where, was heard by the team. What, there, was heard, but not verbal or seen. 

E:
I's disconcerted. 

N:
A snap and a crack broke quiet; quite loud. Blood, then, erupted at hip and on brow. 

E:
Honestly couldn't believe it myself!

Skull, there, more holey - now a bullet went through it.

I must've hit it... my head, too. I know it...

N: 
...he'd deemed at the moment. Delivered with ease. His stories believed by the people at least, as the poor man began to sit back. But suddenly, he turned, there, to Horse in horse whispers; well seen. The crown, then, appeared on, there, old mahogany.

TJ went insane.

Ch 4 - 

"Objection!" the DA laid in. Thought, swore, knew in his head that he'd made him.
"Evidence shows that your words aren't the truth, Mr. Earnheart. Untruths told uh'nuh oath, good sir, dare I say. Dare you to tarnish your word with such smoke? Dare you to ruin your life with such lies?" he asked of the man sat across of the oak. 
"It seems like..."
"Objection?" the defence stepped in. *Finally, Jesus.*

*this part is said by the narrator as a way of connecting the reader more with the actual writing style as it can get quite jarring to jump back and forth between first and third omniscient*

"Only the jury's to speculate, please," said the Judge on the other side of Earn; above he.
"I'd love to say something," said E as a plead, "but they've gummed up the system such that nothing leaves! I came to this town just to water my horse, but now, of course, my journey here leads. I ain't killed no man, damnit! Now please, say your peace!"
Well-meaning men well before them had steeped all these children in deep deep deep sadness. Like tea, but black. Viscous like coffee with turned cream, at that. Frozen, their hearts cold as ice or like stone. So stories had gone of this town in the region of Reeds. 
*Where, evidently enough, these people could not read.* - more narrator, denoted by italics 
"Objection" the DA racked back once again. 
Judge turned to defense. "What would you say, sir, if he should have freedom?"
"It seems like there is'n ever chances for us. With the people these days? I'd plead forgiveness." Council's words wise, as he'd now seen the prince.
"Your Honor! My God!" shouted the DA, "Please!" Lauded him, Judge, had they/them for weeks.



"Hilarity" 
West believes it's a conspiracy to pin a murder on the traveller who came into town just to drink on his travels because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but West actually does have "Hilarity" as the people of the town know it. They just don't know that Hilarity isn't a disease that deteriorates the mind and most people are succumbing to it in less developed parts of society, it's God.
It seems like a less developed society because of the endless deserts between small towns, but it's because the land has been decimated by the societies that are so far ahead of the others that they removed themselves from this world and this is a take on "left behind" in a series of novels of different genres that tell a story of convergence between these characters across multiple stories. The characters all die at the end of their book, but are reincarnated in a new world/book where they tell their stories in a sort of heaven/Valhalla. All the societies on the planet meet each other again and reform the earth to be lush and life-promoting again, not just life-sustaining. It's discovered that all planets sustain life, but not all promote the evolutionary chain continuing. But anyway, west has succumbed to the disease and is unable to cope with awful things so his memory erases those to fill with fantasy. All around, everyone is destroyed by "Hilarity", except for those who have what West has, which is a sort of "off switch" to keep them more peaceful. Those people are usually killed by the people who actually can't cope and do awful things to people because of what they've seen and the Hilarity projects the awful things onto peaceful people.

The character represents the West searching the East for new understanding, but finding desolation and many different manifestations of bad. God gives West gifts as a way of keeping on his journey as he needs to cross the ocean to go home to complete journey.

People moved west to run away from the end of the day, but it's a sphere not a flat earth and he needs to essentially discover that through unintentionally circumnavigating the world due to his "Hilarity" which he interprets as God directing him. It is actually God (cause God's real and shit) and the people don't believe in it so they explain it with ever more creative lies, but it's discovered the people with "hilarity" can still lie as well which creates confusion. There are still good people without "hilarity" but it's overwhelmingly bad and the good is suppressed unless it's convenient truth and the lies are by people who pose as good/have created false good images. 

Write these stories from many perspectives like one of the guys who is a false idol, but succumbs to "hilarity" only to find it is actually God calling him. The storyline assumes concepts like preordination and things like that

Progress the characters from peasants to kings and the king is the last one to get it (it being God is real and the shit), but the chronology bounces back and forth such that West's story is happening after the last story chronologically, but this creates a new sense of chronology that can have events be referenced by other characters at various points in the story (more interesting this way)

One thing I'd like to make huge if possible in every story as another overarching theme is that nobody is a "bad" person. Once that's realized, the next step is forgiveness - which is just as hard and both of those realizations are hard as fuckin fuck. There are only misunderstandings that when cleared up make things ok, but some of the character's stories aren't going to be finished in the series because I'll die before I write a new world of stories from the perspective of 8 billion different people, SO it must be understood somehow that everyone is good, but we all have things that are "bad" about us and some people, in my books it's these main characters who are named that bring a "perfect perspective" but it's because God has placed them there to deliver a certain message that can only come from a particular position. Every main character has faults as well, which would be disposed by at least one if not many of the other societies in these books, but that's the point. They are different worlds. These are different places with different cultures and values that all converge into a story, just like life baby. Rib a dub dub. Thanks for the love. Go God.
